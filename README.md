# Coffee-shop-sql-database
This is a SQL project for a coffee shop where dummy data is added to create views and query the data to access specific information.

## Overview
This project serves as a practice exercise in designing a relational database schema for a coffee shop using SQL. Dummy data is inserted into the database to simulate employee records, shop locations, suppliers, menu items, and more. Views are created to organize and present data in a meaningful way, and queries are executed to retrieve specific information from the database.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience in:

Designing a relational database schema for a specific domain (in this case, a coffee shop).
Populating the database with dummy data to simulate real-world scenarios.
Creating views to organize and present data in a structured format.
Writing SQL queries to extract specific information from the database.

## Tools
Initially, PostgreSQL was used for database management. However, towards the end of the project, SQL Server Management Studio was adopted to create more sophisticated views and queries due to its robust features.

## Future Plans
This project serves as a stepping stone for a larger project - the MovieStore Project. In the MovieStore Project, the knowledge gained from designing the coffee shop database will be applied to create a database for a movie store. The movie store database will include features such as multiple warehouse locations, inventory management, customer records, and more. Additionally, an MVC website using the ASP .NET framework will be developed to provide a user interface for interacting with the movie store database.

Stay tuned for updates on the MovieStore Project!
